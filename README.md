## Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React

I recently developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React, showcasing the following features:

- **Interactive Gameplay:**
  - Enjoy a seamless gaming experience with a user-friendly interface.
  
- **Victory Detection:**
  - The game intelligently detects and announces when a player has won, providing an engaging and competitive environment.

- **Game History:**
  - Implemented a feature to store the history of the game as it progresses. Players can review the sequence of moves and outcomes, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

- **Time-Travel Functionality:**
  - Enabled players to revisit previous versions of the game's board, allowing for a strategic review of the game's progression.

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zahid51095/Tic-Tac-Toe) for those interested in exploring the code and trying out the game. I welcome feedback and collaboration opportunities!
